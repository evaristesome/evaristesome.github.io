        <p>Antenna array signal processing is an actively developing research area in communication technologies and
            connected to the progress in optimization theory, and remains the key technological development that
            attracts more than one.<br>
            Beamforming is a signal processing operation that uses antenna arrays to create a spatial filter. Beamforming
            consists to filter out signals from all directions except the desired direction(s). Beamforming can be used
            to increase SINR (signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio) of desired signals, null out interferers, shape
            beam patterns, or even transmit/receive multiple data streams at the same time and frequency (5G & 6G).<br>

            <br>Antenna arrays have a huge role in radar, where the goal is to detect and track targets.<br>
            This module introduces the theory in narrowband array signal processing beamforming and direction of
            arrival estimation algorithms and the basic principle of array signal processing techniques to further
            understand its implementation process and applications.<br><br>

            Assumptions of the signal mathematical model used in beamforming and DOA estimation algorithms:
            <ul>
                <li> Each array element is an ideal omnidirectional point source, and the inter-element spacing is less than or equal to half-a-wavelength</li>
            <li> Signal sources are assumed to be in the far-field so that the signals impinging on the array can be regarded as a plane wave</li>
            <li> Let us consider a uniform linear array (ULA) topology. Spacing between array elements are equal, e.g. evenly spaced array</li>
            <li> The noise is zero-mean Gaussian white noise, and uncorrelated with the signal source</li>
            <li> The effect of mutual coupling between array elements is assumed to be negligible, i.e., the different
                element receives the same signal amplitude.</li>
            </ul>
            Consider a 1D element uniformly spaced array:<br>
            <center>
                <table class="tg">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                        <th class="tg-0pky">  <img src="images/doa.png" width="600" height="300"> </th>
                            <figcaption>Fig.2 - ULA 1D</figcaption>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                </table>
            </center>
            <br>
            In Fig. 2, a signal is coming in from the right side (pure assumption). It is hitting the right-most element
            first. Consider the signal received by the first array element as a reference signal, then the analytical expression
            for the i−th signal received with respect to the reference array element is <br><br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            \( s_i (t) = m_i (t) e^{j2\pi f_c t},  i  =  0, ..., P-1\) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; (Eq. 1)<br><br>
            where \(m_i (t)\) is the complex envelope of the \( i-th\) modulated signal, and \( f_c\) the carrier frequency.<br>

            <br>The signal received by each array element has a certain delay relative to the origin of the coordinates.
            The delay
            between when the signal hits that first element and when it reaches the next element can be calculated by
            forming the trigonometry problem formulated from Fig.2.
            <center>
                <table class="tg">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                        <th class="tg-0pky">  <img src="images/signal-travel-distance.png" width="600" height="300"> </th>
                            <figcaption>Fig.3 - Delay trigonometry formulation based on Fig. 1</figcaption>

                    </thead>
                </table>
            </center>

            the delay time for the signal received at the i−th  array element is:<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            \( cos(90 - \theta) = \frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse} = \frac{adjacent}{d}\) <br><br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            \( adjacent = d *  cos(90 - \theta) = d * sin(\theta)\) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Remember: <i>cos(a - b) = cos(a)cos(b) + sin(a)sin(b)</i><br>
            The adjacent is just a distance. Convert the adjacent-distance to a time is necessary by using the speed of light:
            \( time_{elapsed} = d \sin(\theta) / c \). This equation applies between any adjacent elements of the array.<br><br>

            The propagation delay of the received signal from reference array element to the \( m−th \) array element
            can be expressed as <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; \( \tau_m (\theta_i) = \frac{d}{c} (m-1) sin(\theta_i)\)
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\( m=1, ..., M \) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; (Eq. 2)<br><br>

            According to (Eq. 1), the signal received at the \(m-th\) array element is the superposition of all signals
            and can be expressed as:<br><br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            \(x_m (t) = \sum_{i=0}^{P-1} m_i (t-\tau_m (\theta_i)) e^{j2\pi f_c (t-\tau_m (\theta_i))} + n_m (t) \) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; (Eq. 3-a)
            <br><br> where \(n_m (t)\) is the Gaussian noise signal received at the \(m-th\) array element having zero mean and variance \(\sigma^2\).
            Recall that when you have a time shift, it is subtracted from the time argument. (Eq. 3-a) can be rewritten:<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            \(x_m (t) = \sum_{i=0}^{P-1} m_i (t-\tau_m (\theta_i)) &emsp;e^{j2\pi f_c t}&emsp;e^{-j2\pi f_c \tau_m (\theta_i)} + n_m (t) \) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; (Eq. 3-b)<br><br>
            Because the carrier component in the system does not affect the analysis, and the adaptive algorithm is
            often carried out in the baseband or complex envelope, the carrier part in the above equation can be ignored.
            The remaining can be expressed as:<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            \(x_m (t) = \sum_{i=0}^{P-1} m_i (t-\tau_m (\theta_i)) &emsp;e^{-j2\pi f_c \tau_m (\theta_i)} + n_m (t) \) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; (Eq. 3-c)<br><br>

            Since we consider a narrowband signal source located in the far-field, the bandwidth \(B\) of the signal satisfy the condition
            \(B<< f_c \), and \(m_i (t)\) changes relatively slowy because the signal delay is \(\tau_m (\theta_i) << \frac{1}{B}\).
            Therefore, the complex envelope of the signal can be approximated as \(m_i (t-\tau_m (\theta_i))\approx m_i (t)\)&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <br><br>

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            \(x_m (t) = \sum_{i=0}^{P-1} m_i (t) &emsp;e^{-j2\pi f_c \tau_m (\theta_i)} + n_m (t) \) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; (Eq. 3-d)<br><br>

            A little detail:<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            \(k=\frac{2\pi f_c}{c}\)&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; \(f_c=\frac{kc}{2\pi}\)&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; where \(k\) is the free space wave number <br><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Recall \( \tau_m (\theta_i) = \frac{d}{c} (m-1) sin(\theta_i)\) <br><br>
            Replacing the above details into (Eq. 3.d) gives: <br><br>

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            \(x_m (t) = \sum_{i=0}^{P-1} m_i (t) &emsp;e^{-j(m-1)kd sin \theta_i} + n_m (t) \) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; (Eq. 3-e)<br><br>

            At time <b>\(t\)</b>, the overall received signal can be expressed as:<br>
            <p>
            \begin{equation}

                    x_1 (t)\\x_2 (t)\\.\\x_M (t)
                \end{bmatrix}
                = Am (t) + n(t) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; (Eq. 4-a)
            \end{equation}
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            \begin{equation}
                x(t) =
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    1 & 1 & ... & 1 \\
                    e^{-jkd sin\theta_0} & e^{-jkd sin\theta_1} & ... & e^{-jkd sin\theta_{P-1}} \\
                    . & . & . & .\\
                    . & . & . & .\\
                    . & . & . & .\\
                    e^{-j(M-1)kd sin\theta_0} & e^{-j(M-1)kd sin\theta_1} & ... & e^{-j(M-1)kd sin\theta_{P-1}}
                \end{bmatrix}
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    m_1 (t) \\
                    m_2 (t) \\
                    . \\
                    . \\
                    . \\
                    m_p (t)
                \end{bmatrix}
                +
                \begin{bmatrix}
                    n_1 (t) \\
                    n_2 (t) \\
                    . \\
                    . \\
                    . \\
                    n_M (t)
                \end{bmatrix}
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; (Eq. 4-b)
            \end{equation}
            </p>
            <br>

            Hence, from Eq. 4-b, we can define:
            <li>The direction matrix:</li>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\(A = [a(\theta_0)&emsp; a(\theta_1)&emsp; ...&emsp; a(\theta_{P-1})]\)

            <li>The array response vector, the steering vector, or the direction vector for the \(i-th\) signal \(s_i (t)\):</li>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\(a(\theta_i) = [1&emsp;e^{-j2\pi f_c \tau_1 (\theta_i)}&emsp;...&emsp;e^{-j2\pi f_c \tau_M (\theta_i)}]^T\) <br><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For instance: \(a(\theta_0) = [1&emsp;e^{-jkd sin \theta_0)}&emsp;...&emsp;e^{-j(M-1)kd sin \theta_0)}]^T\) <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The array response vector is a function of the angle of arrival, individual element response,
            the array &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;geometry and the signal frequency.
            <li>The noise vector:</li>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;\(n(t) = [n_1 (t)&emsp; n_2 (t)&emsp; ...&emsp; n_M (t)]^T\)
            <br><br>
