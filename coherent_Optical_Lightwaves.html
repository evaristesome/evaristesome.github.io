				<ul> Coherent optical and basic concepts definitions:<br><br>
            In coherent optical communication, information is encoded into the electrical field of a lightwave.
            Decoding it entails the direct measurement of the complex electrical field. A coherent requires careful
            phase and polarization management, which turns out to be the main obstacle for the practicale implementation
            of a coherent receiver using optical based management methods.<br>
            This chapter has for aim to provide basic definitions on coherent detection and digital signal
            processing (DSP) which are essential building blocks of modern optical communications.
            Essential definitions have been extracted from the "Digital coherent optical systems", by Darli Augusto.
            <br><br>
            Principle of digital modulation<br>
            When studying communication theory, the first step is to understand how to represent signal in
            the different stages of the system. The process of mapping bits into waveforms and vice-versa is called
            digital modulation. In the transmission by a communication channel, in our case an
            optical fiber, the intensity and phase of an approximately sinusoidal carrier are modified to convey
            information. This process is called modulation. The modulated signal can be represented as:<br><br>
            \(x(t)=\sqrt{2} A(t) \cos(2\pi f_{c} t + \phi (t))\) &nbsp (1) <br><br>
            where \(f_{c}\) is the carrier frequency, \(A(t)\) and \(\phi(t)\) respectively the amplitude and phase
            modulation components. The \(\sqrt{2}\) factor normalizes the energy of the \(\cos(.)\) function. We call
            this a passband signal representation. A further way on writing (1) is <br><br>
            \(x(t) = \sqrt{2} x_{I}(t)\cos(2\pi f_{c}t) - \sqrt{2} x_{Q}(t)\sin(2\pi f_{c}t)\) <br><br>
            where \(x_{I}(t) = A(t)\cos(\phi(t))\) and \(x_Q (t) = A(t) \sin(\phi (t))\) are the in-phase and
            quadrature components. Here we assume \(f_c > W/2\), where W is the spectral support of \(x_Q (t)\)
            and \(x_I (t)\). <br>
            It is possible to adopt another representation of the transmitted signals that suppress the dependence of
            the carrier frequency using complex numbers, call the baseband representation.
            The baseband representation of \(x(t)\) is <br><br>
            \(x_b (t)= x_I (t) + i x_Q (t)\) <br><br>
            Note that \(x(t)\) can be easily obtained back from \(x_b (t)\) by <br><br>
            \(x(t) = \sqrt {2} \Re\{x_b (t) e^{(i2\pi f_c t)}\}\)

            <br><br>
            In digital transmission systems with passband pulse amplitude modulation (PAM),
            the continuous time signals \(x_I (t)\) and \(x_Q (t)\) can be expressed as a sum of time-delayed
            continuous wave forms: <br><br>
            \(x_I (t)= \sum_{k} x_k^I g(t-kT_s )\) <br><br>
            \(x_Q (t) = \sum_{k} x_k^Q g(t-kT_s )\) <br><br>
            where \(T_s\) is the symbol period. We assume that signals \(x_I (t)\) and \(x_Q (t)\) have the same
            pulse shape \(g(t)\) and discrete in-phase and quadrature components \(x_k^I\) and \(x_k^Q\). <br>
            Depending on the choice of \(x_k^I\) and \(x_k^Q\), various modulation formats, represented by their
            constellation are implemented.<br><br>
            On-off keying (OOK) constellation has only two symbols, one with amplitude zero and the other with
            amplitude A. (OOK) is used in intra-office applications. <br><br>
            The second simplest modulation format is the binary phase-shift keying (BPSK). In BPSK, the two
            transmitted constellation symbols are in symmetric position with respect to the origin.
            At reception, coherent detection is required for polarity discrimination. BPSK uses only one degree
            of freedom, i.e., the modulation of the in-phase component. The simplest modulation format that
            exploits the two degrees of freedom provided by the complex plane is the quadrature phase-shift
            keying (QPSK) format. QPSK and BPSK are considered phase modulation formats because their amplitude
            is kept constant for all the constellation symbols. <br><br>
            A widely used family of modulation formats that achieves excellent performance is the M-ary
            quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM). In M-QAM, \(\sqrt{M}\) amplitude levels of the in-phase and
            quadrature component are uniformly distributed and independently modulated. Usually, \(M=L^2\), and \(L\)
             is a power of two. <br>

            Another important issue is how to map bits into constellation symbols. It is desirable that adjacent
            symbols are mapped to code words that differ by a small number of bits, ideally only one.
            In this way, even if one symbol conveys \(m = \log (M)\) bits, most symbols errors cause only one bit error.
            This is achieved by an approach known as Gray mapping.<br>
            There are several metrics to evaluate the performance of a modulation format, one of them is the
            spectral efficiency \((SE)\). It is defined as the ratio between the conveyed net bit rate, \(R_b\),
            and the bandwidth to support this rate, \(W\).<br><br>
            Receiver:
            The most common channel is the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel for which the received
            signal \(r(t)\) is given by:<br><br>
            \( r(t)=x(t)+ \eta (t)\) <br><br>
            where \(\eta(t)\) is the white Gaussian noise with a power spectral density to \(N_0/2\)  over the entire
            spectrum. It is useful under the considerations that \(r(t)\)  is filtered at the receiver,
            and the noise power of interest is that within the signal bandwidth. After the matched filter,
            the discrete complex baseband signal \(y_k\) is the sum of the original signal components \(x_k\)
            with a white Gaussian noise component \(\eta_{k}\):<br><br>
            \(y_k=x_k + \eta_{k}\) <br><br>
            The in-phase and the quadrature components of \(y_k\)  are given by <br><br>
            \(y_k^I=x_k^I+ \eta_k^I\) <br><br>
            \(y_k^Q=x_k^Q+ \eta_k^Q\) <br><br>
            Where \(\eta_k^I\) and \(\eta_k^Q\) are zero-mean white Gaussian noise processes with variance
            \(N_0/2\) in the in-phase and quadrature components. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), calculated
            as the ratio of signal and noise powers considering both the in-phase and the quadrature components,
            can be expressed as SNR defined in terms of the signal power per bit as <br><br>
            \(SNR_b = E_b / N_0\)
            where \(E_b\) is the power per bit \((E_b/b)\), and \(b\) is the number of conveyed bits per
            symbol.<br><br>
            Laser <br>
            Optical modulation <br>
            We learned some basic concepts of digital modulation, and how information is conveyed by modifying
            the amplitude and phase of a carrier.<br>
            Semiconductor lasers can generate carriers with relatively narrow linewidth, with some tens or
            some few hundreds of KHz. Optical transmitters follow the same principle as any passband communication
            systems:<br>
            First, bits of information are sent from a data source to a symbol mapper that performs the
            assignment of symbols according to the constellation of a specific modulation format. Then, a
            shaping filter is used to generate pulses conveying the mapped symbols. This is all carried out in
            the digital domain, i.e., in a digital signal processing. Therefore, before transmitting the signal
            over the channel, digital-to-analog (DAC) converters are required to generate analog waveforms.
            Finally, these signals are sent to an optical modulator that converts the input analog electric
            signals into a modulated optical carrier.<br>
            In fiber optic communication systems, direct modulation is the simplest technique used to modulate an
            optical carrier. Direct modulation modifies the driving current of a semiconductor laser causing
            variations in the amplitude of the generated optical signal according to the information to be sent.
            As disadvantage, direct modulation produces pulses that are affected by chirp, which are continuous
            variations of the optical frequency during a symbol period. Chirp causes spectral broadening and
            limits the transmission rate in several ways, for example, impairing phase modulation.<br><br>

            a) – Phase modulator<br>
            The phase modulator (PM) is a device that relies on the pockels effect to imprint variations in the
            phase of an optical carrier. Such a device is comprised of a waveguide, which is generally lithium
            niobate \((LiNbO_{3})\) surrounded by a pair of electrodes that enable the application of an electric
            voltage.<br>
            b) – Mach-Zehnder modulator<br>
            The Mach-Zehnder modulator \((MZM)\) is a device that uses the principle of interference between
            propagating signals to generate amplitude and phase modulation. Its name stems from the fact that
            the structure employed to generate interference between the propagating signals is based on a
            Mach-Zehnder interferometer \((MZI)\). The optical signal entering the structure is divided into two
            distinct arms. In each of these arms, a phase modulator acts on the propagating optical signal by
            performing a phase shift proportional to the applied electric voltage. After this process, the optical
            signal from the two arms are recombined, and depending on the phase difference between them,
            a constructive or destructive interference pattern is observed.<br>
            c) – In-phase and quadrature modulator<br>
            The in-phase and quadrature modulator \((IQM)\) is a component that is capable of generating
            constellation symbols at any position in the complex plane. Its structure consists of a
            combination of two \(MZM\) and one \(\pi/2\) PM.<br>
            d) – Dual polarization modulator<br>
            In addition to conveying information in the phase and amplitude of the optical signal, digital
            coherent optical systems also uses polarization as an additional degree of freedom.<br><br>

            Optical receiver front-end, orthogonalization, and deskew <br><br>

            Deskew: responsible for compensating for possible temporal mismatches in the alignment of the four received
            components.<br>
            Chromatic dispersion: different spectral components of a guided mode propagate with distinct group
            velocities gives rise to the phenomenon known as chromatic dispersion. If left uncompensated, chromatic dispersion broadens the propagating pulses and lead to
            inter-symbol interference \((ISI)\). In optical fiber, chromatic dispersion is generated by two main
            contributions. The first one, called material dispersion, is related to the material from which the fiber
            is made. The second one is called waveguide dispersion, arises from the fact that part of the energy
            of the transmitted signal propagates in the fiber core, and another part in the fiber cladding.<br>
            Optical receiver: In optical receivers, the conversion of the optical signal into electric currents is
            performed by the photodetector.<br>
            Photodetectors: are optoelectronic devices that generate an electric current that is proportional to the
            squared modulus of the optical input field.<br>

            Coherent receivers are, by definition, structures that mix an input signal at frequency \(\omega_{c}\),
            with a local oscillator at frequency \(\omega_{LO}\), to recover the phase of the input carrier.<br>
            Mixing is a nonlinear operation that downconverts the signal at frequency \(\omega_{c}\) to the intermediate
            frequency \(\omega_{IF} = \omega_{c} - \omega_{LO}\) <br><br>

            <a href="https://evaristesome.github.io/direct-coherent-detection.html">Coherent detection </a> can be
            classified into homodyne, heterodyne, and intradyne detection.<br>
            In homodyne detection, \(\omega_{c} = \omega_{LO}\), and the signal after mixing is at baseband.<br>
            In heterodyne detection,  \(\omega_{c} \neq \omega_{LO}\), and a second downconversion procedure is required to
            recover the signal from the intermediate frequency \(\omega_{IF}\) to baseband.<br>
            Coherent optical systems implement an intradyne detector, for which
            \(\omega_{c} \approx \omega_{LO}\). In this case, downconversion from \(\omega_{IF} \approx 0\) to baseband is
            carried out by frequency recovery algorithms implemented by DSP.<br>

            Deskew block compensates for a temporal misalignment between in-phase and quadrature components at the
            output of ADCs, called skew.<br><br>

            Orthogonalization<br>
            Ideally, the in-phase and quadrature components received in the \(V\) and \(H\) polarization orientations
            of the receiver front-end are orthogonal, in the sense that they are uncorrelated.<br>
            However, transmitter or receivers imperfections may cause imbalances that induce a loss of orthogonality.
            Some examples of imperfections that contributes to these imbalances are the incorrect biasing of in-phase
            and quadrature modulators, and imperfections in power dividers, optical couplers, and hybrids.<br>
            Non-orthogonality between the in-phase and quadrature components translates into distortions in the
            received signal constellation, affecting the system performance.<br>
            The higher the order of the modulation format, the more severe are the performance penalties.<br>
            The orthogonalization stage aims to recover the orthogonal characteristic between the in-phase and
            quadrature components of the signals. There are several techniques that accomplish this task, being
            the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure the most common in optical receivers.

            <br><br>
            Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) <br>
            OFDM subcarrier channel signals are orthogonal to one another
                <ul>
                    <li>Subcarrier frequencies are chosen so that the subcarriers are orthogonal to each other,</li>
                    <li>at the center of each subcarrier, signals contribution from other subcarriers is zero</li>
                    <li>crosstalk between the sub-channels is eliminated and inter-carrier guard bands are not required</li>
                    <li>orthogonality requires that the subcarrier spacing is \(\Delta f = \frac {1}{T_{U}}\) Hertz, where \(T_{U}\) seconds is the useful symbol duration
                    with N subcarriers, the total passband bandwidth will be \(B ≈ N·\Delta f\) (Hz) </li>
                    <li>Orthogonality  allows high spectral efficiency. </li>

            Error correction for coherent optical communication<br>
            Forward Error Correction (FEC) coding is based on deterministically adding redundant bit to a source information
            bit sequence. After a transmission over a noisy channel, a decoding system tries to exploit the redundant
            information for fully recovering the source information.<br>
            Several methods for generating bit sequence from the source information bits are known. One example is the
            low-density parity check (LDPC).<br><br>
            Differential coding: is a technique used to provide unambiguous signal reception when using some types of
            modulations.
