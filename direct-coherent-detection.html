                 Direct detection uses the amplitude of the light to encode the information. The transmission distance
                to achieve depends on the data rate of the signal that is used. At lower data rates, the link length can
                achieve 100th of kilometers. However, as the data rate or the signal speed goes up, the link length
                decrease exponentially.<br><br>
                In coherent transmission, rather than using the amplitude to encode information, properties of the
                light, such as phase and polarization. Consequently, this increase the data rate while still being able
                to transmit over long distances.<br><br>
                In direct detection, the laser on the transmitting side converts the electrical to optical On-Off
                pulses and sends through the optical medium. The laser pulses are then received by the photodiode on
                the receiving end, and converts back into electrical signals. As light pulses go through the fiber,
                they get smeared out. Such phenomenon is called dispersion. At higher throughput, dispersion effects
                become more problematic because pulses get closer together. As pulses start overlapping to each other,
                it then becomes difficult, even impossible for the photodetector to correctly detect each individual
                pulse at the received end.<br><br>
                To overcome dispersion effect and increase transmission speed, an alternative approach is needed.
                Apart from just using the amplitude or intensity to encode information, phase can be used by changing
                the delay between pulses and the polarization, which is the orientation of the signal.
                By combining amplitude, phase, and polarization changes, we can encode three bits in the same time span.
                A coherent detection technique can be used to received the signal, which uses a local oscillator
                to generate a reference signal and to compare with the incoming signal. Mixing the two signals
                coherently, the amplitude and phase information per polarization can be reconstructed.
                The reconstructed signals are fed into the digital signal processing algorithms to compensate any
                transmission impairments such as dispersion.
