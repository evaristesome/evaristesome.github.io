                <h4>5G NR Physical Reference Signals and Channels</h4>
                5G NR uses various reference signals and physical channels to facilitate NR air interface operations.
                In 5G NR, new reference signals are introduced to support diverse frequency ranges, massive MIMO,
                and beam forming.<br>

                <h4>Scalable 5G NR OFDM Numerology</h4>
                5G NR supports multiple OFDM subcarrier spacing (SCS) to efficiently address 5G diverse spectrums,
                deployments and services.<br>

                <h4>Simulating Carrier Configuration using PHY channel Uplink PUSCH</h4>
                The cyclic prefix length depends on the subcarrier spacing. When choosing larger subcarrier spacing,
                let's see what happens:<br>

                </center>
                The cyclic prefix has shrunk from 5.2us to 1.69us and the number of slots per frame has increased from 10 to 40.<br>

            <p style="background-color:LightGray;" align="justify"><b></b> to prepare America for the 21st century we must harness the powerful
            forces of science and technology to benefit all Americans. This is the first State of the Union carried
            live in video over the Internet. But we've only begun to spread the benefits of a technology revolution
            that should become the modern birthright of every citizen. </p>

            <p align="justify">While much of the country has access to telecommunication services, which include iPhones, internet,
            and computers, Native Americans living on tribal reservations do not have the same access. The United States
            was built on the foundation of colonization, racism, and genocide. This is an original sin of America,
            but it is not just a sin of the past. Nowadays, compared to the rest of the U.S. population, Native
            Americans have significantly lower median incomes, lower homeownership, lower education, increasing health
            disparities, lagging behind the new technology adoption, and three times the level of poverty. Do these
            outcomes show the continuation of the original sin or constitute the effects of a system of new-colonization
                supremacy?</p>

            <p align="justify">The FCC in their 2015 Broadband Progress Report found that 63% of residents on tribal lands lacked access
            to fixed broadband, compared to 17% of the entire population in the United States. On rural tribal lands,
            approximately 85% of residents lack fixed broadband services.
            The FCC 2015 Broadband Progress Report shows that nearly 2/3 of residents lack access to today’s speeds.
            And 35% of schools across the nation still lack access to fiber networks capable of delivering the advanced
                broadband required to support today’s digital-learning tools.</p>

            <p align="justify">In the 2024 annual report examining the state of broadband deployment in the United States, the Federal
            Communications Commission (FCC) adopted its annual assessment of whether advanced telecommunications
            capability is being deployed in a reasonable and timely fashion across the U.S. In addition to deployment,
            the report considers broadband affordability, adoption, availability, and equitable access, when determining
            whether broadband is being deployed in a reasonable and timely fashion to “all Americans.” The Commission’s
            Report, issued pursuant to Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, raises the Commission’s
            benchmark for high-speed fixed broadband to download speeds of 100 megabits per second and upload speeds of
                20 megabits per second.</p>
